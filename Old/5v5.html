						<h3>The Artifact</h3>
						<p>The Artifact Developed from the project was 5v5 Game which 100 bots played and the results from this were saved from each match. This then was processed by the Skill Rating system after each match was played. The bots were then placed in the Skill Groups and Rematched.  </p>
						<h3>The Development Process</h3>
						<p>The first step in the developement was the Bots. They use the Unreal Engine Desision Trees and Blueprints to Move and perform the Shooting Actions. The Bots use the EQS system for movement using intrest points on the maps.</p>
						<p>After this a game controller was made for each match. This would control the spawn points for each bot as well as the score and any changes that happen midmatch such as swaping spawns.</p>
						<p>Because I wanted 10 games to be played at same time I made a server controller. This controls which bots were placed in each match as well as placing them with bots with similar Skill Rating.</p>
						<p>At the end of each map the bots current Skill Rating was adjusted using the Elo Algorthim, TrueSkill Algorthim and Finally my Own Algorthim. The process was repeated to simulate people playing multiple matches</p>
						<p>Data from each game was recorded to a JSON file. This included the bots in each match K/D the result of the game and the Skill Rating or in TrueSkill system the Mu and Sigma</p>
