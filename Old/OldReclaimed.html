						<h3>Reflective Evaluation</h3>
						<p>This project allowed for a deeper exploration of many topics that have been researched and made before as well as expanding on new mechanics such as API integration which was a tough process to initially explore. This final artifact also gave a deep insight into the development of a platform-specific platform which included making design decisions on the controls and making changes to help with performance. Overall this project has forced a lot of challenges but most of them were overcome with research and online forums to help sort many issues. When developing future applications the knowledge gained from this project will be valuable with the planning systems will be planned and tested before final builds.</p>
