									<h3 class="major">Where is did games start for me?</h3>
									
									<p><img src="images/pic10.png" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:256px;height:256px;">
									<p>Games started for me with my Nintendo DS that I once got for my birthday. Lets just say I fell in love with games such as the PoKeMon series such as platium and white and black being my most played. I have countless memories playing this games late in the night way past bed time. This game console was my life for year upgrading to a DSI when it came out just so I could have a camera and because my other was beginning to look old. After all this I was one of those kids that didnt get a console i got my first laptop and took up the games Minecraft. Truely one of the best games in excistence, this game kept me entertain for years.</p>
									<h3 class="major">What Happened to me after</h3>
									<p>Well after playing years of minecraft I went to a gaming event and got to see live CSGO pro level matches and got to play myself. I instantly fell in love with the shooter and have been addicted to it for years. (unfortunately i still play it today). In 2016 one game that came out changed my life. DOOM. This game caught my eye when I saw the brutal glory kills and the fast gameplay which I thought would suit my fast and agile playstyle. Lets just say I loved it.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Other things in my life apart from games</h3>
									<p>Apart from games I have gained a keen intrest in PC hardware. This is made me wanna build multiple computers from the age of twelve and still saving to buy more PC componets. Also in my life I took up Karate. I started at the age of Ten and worked all the way to black belt. This allowed me to compete at national level adn win gold twice at fighting competions. </p>
									<h3 class="major">Epic Life Changing Things</h3>
									<p>Apart from doing all that I was an exploer. This is one of my best life experience. I met so many amazing people and learnt so many amazing skills. In the last couple of years I had to take a leadership role due to are leader basically giving up. This meant I had to run nights and help with planning a prep for bigger projects. One of my greatest achievements was helping fundraising from a group trip to spain where we got to do a bunch of activities for two weeks. Being in such a important role really grew me as a person and litterally changed my life.<p>
